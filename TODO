Labelled/identified nodes.
- So they can be consistently referenced by Go code.
- All stateful nodes can be labelled?

Value nodes.
- Input and Output in one node?

Labelled (wireless) connections.

Mathematical expression nodes.
- Input constants as e.g. "math.Pi"; display them as symbol.

Mathematical constant nodes (pi, phi, sqrt2, ...).
- Just use math expr node?

Sample rate/period nodes.
- Just use math expr node and allow "dsp.SampleRate/Period" as a symbol?

All nodes are stateful.
- Then arbitrary float32 functions will not be mistaken as nodes.
- Simplifies I/O.

Compare float32 vs float64 performance.
- On realistically large processing graphs.
- On basic nodes.

Multiple taps in Delay nodes.
