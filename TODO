Delay:
- special builtin
- one Write, one or more Reads
- named
- add Reads from a context menu on the Write node, or by duplicating a Read node
- Write precedes Read unless otherwise constrained
  - visually merge Reads that succeed the Write (feedforward) into the Write node
  - when a Read node precedes a Write, disconnect it from the Write
- two types (or modes) of Read:  time delay and sample delay
  - inferred by the type of the delay input:
    - float: time
	- int: sample
	- no input:
	  - feedback: single sample
	  - feedforward: zero (pointless)
- delay input for feedback Read should compensate for extra single sample delay by subtracting one sample period from the delay time before doing the lookup

Variable:
- much like a single sample delay but for events, not audio
  - mutiple writes allowed
  - named
  - of different types, perhaps? not just numeric
